## About CAIRN Trust Fabric

**CAIRN Trust Fabric** is an enterprise-grade governance and execution plane designed to bring deterministic control, cryptographic verification, and hardware-isolated execution to artificial intelligence systems.

As organizations deploy autonomous AI agents, coding copilots, and multi-model workflows, they encounter a critical structural problem: **probabilistic language models cannot guarantee safety, idempotency, or policy adherence at runtime**. 

CAIRN resolves this by operating as an unbypassable intermediary layer:
* **Default-Deny Ingress**: Intercepts every tool invocation, shell command, code execution request, and outbound network attempt before host exposure.
* **Dual-Runtime Hardware Sandboxes**: Dispatches unverified workloads into ephemeral Linux Docker containers or native Windows Sandbox Hyper-V micro-VMs.
* **Tiered Assurance Verification**: Evaluates actions across a structured 6-tier ladder from unverified strings to deterministic, repeatable outcomes.
* **Cryptographic Decision Ledgers**: Produces tamper-evident audit trails with SHA-256 decision records to satisfy regulatory mandates (EU AI Act, SOC 2, ISO 42001).

## The 4-Tier Cairn Trust Architecture

The stacked cairn mark represents the 4-tier execution architecture:

```
         +---------------------------------------+
         |         1. INTENT LAYER (Top)         |  Schema Validation & AST Parsing
         +-------------------+-------------------+
                             |
                             v
         +---------------------------------------+
         |         2. GOVERNANCE LAYER           |  Dynamic RBAC, Egress Gate & ACLs
         +-------------------+-------------------+
                             |
                             v
         +---------------------------------------+
         |         3. EXECUTION LAYER            |  Dual Sandboxes (Docker / WinVM)
         +-------------------+-------------------+
                             |
                             v
         +---------------------------------------+
         |      4. EVIDENCE LAYER (Base)         |  SHA-256 Decision Ledger & SIEM
         +---------------------------------------+
```

1. **Tier 1: Intent & Ingress Gate** — Ingests user and agent intent, validates parameter schemas, performs Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, and filters prompt injection vectors.
2. **Tier 2: Policy & Governance Engine** — Evaluates organizational policies in microseconds, applying credential redaction, egress domain whitelisting, and strict least-privilege RBAC.
3. **Tier 3: Dual-Runtime Sandbox Execution** — Dynamically routes workloads to read-only Linux Docker containers or isolated Windows Sandbox Hyper-V micro-VMs.
4. **Tier 4: Cryptographic Evidence Ledger** — Generates signed SHA-256 decision records, state-delta hashes, and real-time SIEM event streams.

## Verification Assurance Ladder

Every recommendation and automated action is graded across 6 deterministic assurance tiers (ADR-0008 compliant):

| Tier | Status | Verification Stage | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | `[UNTRUSTED]` | **Unverified** | Raw LLM output string or unparsed external script. |
| **1** | `[INSPECTED]` | **Static Checked** | AST syntax validation, secret regex scan, and boundary parsing. |
| **2** | `[ISOLATED]` | **Sandbox Executed** | Ephemeral container execution with read-only root and zero network egress. |
| **3** | `[OBSERVED]` | **Behaviour Checked** | Memory, disk delta, and network telemetry verified clean. |
| **4** | `[REPRODUCIBLE]` | **Deterministic** | Multirun output verified to produce identical results across independent seeds. |
| **5** | `[VERIFIED]` | **Idempotent** | State mutations proven safe to repeat without system side-effects. |

## Quickstart

CAIRN Trust Fabric binaries are packaged and signed via official GitHub Releases.

1. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Download the distribution package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cairn-trust-fabric/cairn/releases/latest):
   * `cairn-windows-x64.exe`
   * `SHA256SUMS.txt`

2. **Verify Binary Integrity**:
   Verify cryptographic hash matching the release manifest:
   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash .\cairn-windows-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
   ```

3. **Initialize the Trust Fabric Runtime**:
   ```powershell
   .\cairn-windows-x64.exe --help
   ```
